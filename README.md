# University System

University System implemented with Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB and Express.

## Dependencies

This project uses the dependancies:

* express" simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications by providing features for handling HTTP request, routing, middleware, and more.
* mongodb is a NOSQL database that stores data in JSON-life format. 
* mongoose is an Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level schema-based abstraction over raw MongoDB operations, making it easier to interact with mongoDB.
